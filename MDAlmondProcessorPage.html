    <p class="small-text">Created by: <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Contact Thomas Martin for more information: (559) 321-4488 tmartin@trece.com</span>Thomas Martin</span></p>
    <p class="intro">Mating Disruption has been shown to reduce damage due to NOW by 50%-80% (Haviland 2020). Typically, as you accumulate larger, contiguous acreage under mating disruption, you can expect better results.</p>
    <p class="intro">The model estimates a 50% reduction in damage by decreasing the Original Rejects % by 50%. For example:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>10% Damage -> 5% Damage</li>
        <li>5% Damage -> 2.5% </li>
        <li>2% Damage -> 1%</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="intro">Next, choose your Processor to determine which Quality Bonus Schedule is used.</p>
    <p class="intro">Most processors incentivize lower damage by adding between $0-$0.20/lbs based on the damage assessment and several other factors. Most processors also penalize EXTREMELY HIGH damage, as well.</p>

    <p class="large-text">Which Processor would you like to look at?</p>

    <button onclick="location.href='AlmondExampleBMDROI.html'">Example B</button>
    <button onclick="location.href='AlmondNoProcessorMD.html'">No Processor</button>   
    <p class = "intro"> If you process your own nuts, choose "No Processor" and quality bonus incetives will not be used.</p>
    <p class = "intro"> NOTE: Some Processors give higher base prices, while others give higher quality bonus incentives; this tool is NOT meant to compare pricing schedules for processors!</p>
