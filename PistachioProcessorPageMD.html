    <p class="intro">Mating Disruption has been shown to reduce damage due to NOW by 50% or more. Typically, as you accumulate larger, contiguous acreage under mating disruption, you can expect better results.</p>
    <p class="intro">The model estimates a 50% reduction in damage by decreasing the Original Rejects % by 50%. For example:</p>
    <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>10% Damage -> 5% Damage</li>
        <li>5% Damage -> 2.5% </li>
        <li>2% Damage -> 1%</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="intro">Next, choose your Processor to determine which Quality Bonus Schedule is used.</p>
    <p class="intro">Most processors incentivize lower damage by adding between $0-$0.25/lbs based on the damage assessment and several other factors. Most processors also penalize EXTREMELY HIGH damage, as well.</p>
  <p class="large-text">Which Processor would you like to look at?</p>
