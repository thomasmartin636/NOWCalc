    <h1>Almond Winter Sanitation Research Summary</h1>
    <p class="small-text">Created by: <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Contact Thomas Martin for more information: (559) 321-4488 tmartin@trece.com</span>Thomas Martin</span></p>
    <p class="intro">From 2003-2006, Joel Siegel and Brad Higbee recorded the relatioship between mummies/tree and NOW damage in almonds for almost 2,000 almond blocks (Higbee 2009).</p>
    <p class="intro">The model uses the relationship between mummies/tree and NOW damage to estimate how winter sanitation benefits your ochard. See the graph below:</p>
    <div class="graph-container">
        <img src="WSGraph.png" alt="Graph">
    </div>
    <p class="intro">The above graph will be used to estimate your Damage (Reject %) at the processor based on the mummies in your orchard.</p>
    <p class="intro">Next, choose your Processor to determine which Quality Bonus Schedule is used.</p>
    <p class="intro">Most processors incentivize lower damage by adding between $0-$0.20/lbs based on the damage assessment and several other factors. Most processors also penalize EXTREMELY HIGH damage, as well.</p>

    <p class="large-text">Which Processor would you like to look at?</p>
    <button onclick="location.href='AlmondExampleAWSROI.html'">Example A</button>
    <button onclick="location.href='AlmondExampleBWSROI.html'">Example B</button>
    <button onclick="location.href='AlmondNoProcessorWS.html'">No Processor</button>   
    <p class = "intro"> If you process your own nuts, choose "No Processor" and quality bonus incetives will not be used.</p>
    <p class = "intro"> NOTE: Some Processors give higher base prices, while others give higher quality bonus incentives; this tool is NOT meant to compare pricing schedules for processors!</p>
    <p>More processors coming soon! If you'd like to help add your processor, please contact <span class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">Contact info: (559) 321-4488 tmartin@trece.com</span>Thomas Martin</span>.</p>
